Part of what I like about this quote is just the demonstration of how long humanity has known about the power of reflection (which appears to be uniquely human). Seneca lived when we swapped over the calendars from BCE to CE. [Modern science](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/supersurvivors/202009/the-power-of-journaling) concurs, though there's a little more focus on _gratitude_ today. The other big thing that I like about the quote is the way that it fits in with the rest of the things that have resonated with me here. Just looking back to last week and the [Maxwell quote]( {{< ref "quotes/maxwell-spending-time" >}}). The best way to know if you're spending your time on the ways that advance your purpose in life is to take a periodic pulse and do that reflection.

And daily seems to be the right cadence. At times, it feels far too frequent, and I do miss some days. But so much happens in a day that even after just a day, my reflection is often cursory. Like most of these, I still have a large window of opportunity for growth in the reflection, so it's a good reminder for me (and hopefully for you as well!)
