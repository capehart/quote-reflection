This is kind of a continuation of last week! Habits/routines are a way to help achieve the consistency we talked about last week. I still haven't read either of the books "[Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/465OOtC)" by James Clear or "[The Power of Habit](https://amzn.to/4rjqhdh)" by Charles Duhigg, but AFAIK, they both drive home this message. Most people don't think brushing their teeth is fun. They wouldn't go out of their way to brush their teeth, but it's a part of their daily/nightly routine. They don't have to decide to brush their teeth today, it's just a thing that happens. So, building a routine that meets your goals means you don't have to decide each time whether you are willing to do the work required of your goal. It just happens because it's built in to your day, your habits, your identity. And so, you can be consistent with your progress toward your goals.
