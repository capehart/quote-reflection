I know that I fall frequently into the trap of believing that I see "reality". When really, I get a variety of electric signals to my brain which then interprets them. It usually seems like a distinction without significance, but it's part of why I always want to know how magic tricks are performed. I need the map to make sense.
And as much as I think Thoreau is right here, I wish this were worded better. Though I've not thought of a way to do so. "Looking at" is still active participation in deciding. We often find what we look for. It's why one of my early management coaches would repeat "_look for what you like_." Business books seem to never tire of pointing out that auto racers don't look at the wall they're trying to avoid. They look at the line they're trying to follow. So, I think the question is what you look at **and** what you see!

I like this take on seeing, but I don't think this series is going to earn me anywhere near the $110 that it would cost me to actually include the image, so you'll have to go see it yourself: https://www.cartoonstock.com/cartoon?searchID=CX909274
