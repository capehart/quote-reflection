Oof. Yeah, I have a love/hate relationship with this one. In my world, both firefighting and fire marshaling are important. While fire marshaling is arguably more important, the house that's burning now often brings an urgency that can't be ignored. So, I think the issue is how do you as little as possible in the firefighter realm so that you can optimize for fire marshal time.

It gets even more complicated when fire fighting is emotionally satisfying ("I saved your house!") and fire marshaling is the opposite ("Yes, I'm making your construction project take an extra 3 days while you wait for my inspector to become available."). And yet, improving this skill is the essence of being entrusted with more responsibility. In the beginning, if you're a great firefighter, you get to lead teams of fire fighters, junior fire fighters look up to you. But so long as your focus is just fire fighting then you get stuck in reactive mode, just having more fires. It takes an almost counter-intuitive effort to start to let some fires burn.
