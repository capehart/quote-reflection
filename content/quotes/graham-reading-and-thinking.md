This is one of those I believe, but with less credible evidence. It seems reasonable that reading and writing correlate at least moderately. (Though I observe that I could watch a lot of movies and still have no idea how to create one!) What I like about the relationship between writing and thinking is that having to produce an artifact (especially a written artifact) is that it does tend to force thinking through the details in order to be able to fully represent something. That is part of the reason that [Amazon moved away from Powerpoint](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/amazon-jeff-bezos-powerpoint-meetings-how-to-think.html) to the "6-pager".   So, I think the upshot here is just "writing helps thinking and reading helps writing." So, while you may not get the same dopamine hit from a novel as you will from the next YouTube short, to the extent you want to be a better thinker, it's a good idea to spend your time reading.
