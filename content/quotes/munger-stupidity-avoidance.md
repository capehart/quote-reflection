For me, the most important word in this quote is "consistently". Consistency in anything is very difficult. I use "going to the gym" as an example for this. Plenty of people have had gym memberships, so can relate. Early on, you're enthusiastic for your new gym membership. You go, you're excited, maybe a little intimidated, And the first few workouts are good. You feel sore, you know you worked. But then a few weeks later, you've got a conflict on one of your gym days, or you accidentally oversleep an alarm, then that becomes a skip day. Soon, you don't have a regular schedule of gym-going, but you make it when you can. A few months later, you're like "yeah, I haven't been in a while, but I might, I need to keep renewing the gym membership. Consistency is difficult. For going to the gym, I use the phrase, "consistency beats intensity." Just go. Every day. If you don't have time, walk in, lift one single dumbbell, and walk out.
Buffett (Munger's partner) is often credited with a related sentiment:

    Rule 1: Don't lose money;
    Rule 2: Don't forget rule number one.

The real path to success isn't flash-in-the-pan brilliance, it's consistent avoidance of setbacks.
