This is just one of the many references to the importance of stubborn determination. The rediculousness of trying to cross the Apls with a batallion of elephants didn't seem possible, much less reasonable. Yet, it was done, to significant tactical benefit in the Second Punic War but also at great cost having started with 70,000 men and arriving in Italy with 35,000.
