This is also reminiscent of the Edison quote:

> "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."

or the evolved saying 

> "you never fail until you stop trying".

All of which is to say, the persistence is a virtue. And concurrently, any virtue taken to an extreme may also be a vice. The (misattributed) Einstein quote about doing the same thing and expecting different result, the already referenced [Covey quote]({{< ref "quotes/tartakower-tactics-and-strategy" >}}) about making sure the ladder you're climbing is leaning against the right structure, or the quote possibly from Will Rogers, 

> "When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging".

All of which is to say, I think there's a lot of wisdom in a lot of the quotes we've been exploring, and the application to ones own particular life circumstance are only knowable to the person living that life!
