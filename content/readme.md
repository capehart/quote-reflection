Hi. I'm [AC Capehart](https://accapehart.com/). I work for a small home performance company called [Pearl](https://pearlscore.com/). As I progress through life, I notice things that resonate with me, and try to capture them for reflection. Originally, I created these for colleagues and they were kind of slap-dash. The writing clearly needed to improve. I intend to continue posting these weekly and be at least a little more careful in the reflection prose.

The images are AI-generated (_ComfyUI, Flux, with a prompt written by Claude!_) based on the quote and have cracked me up. As long as they've not been patently offensive, I've left them as they came to me.

I've also tried to be fairly rigorous with the quote validation. If it's referenced somewhere like "Quote Investigator", I've marked it as "high," confidence. If the main attribution I found was somewhere like GoodReads, I've marked the attribution as uncertain. And, of course, as we continue to interpret ancient Greek and Roman texts, the wisdom of the ancients is generally at least translated and paraphrased even if we're reasonably confident in the attribution itself.

I hope you find something here of value, even if it's just the reference to some of the accumulated wisdom of others.
